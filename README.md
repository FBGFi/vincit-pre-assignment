# Instructions of use
Normally the build folder would not be included in the repository.
However, I added it for ease of use. Simply download the build folder
and open the index.html inside.

Alternatively, provided that you have the required tools installed for
compiling React with TypeScript, you can either serve the app with `npm start`
or rebuild the application with `npm run build`.

After opening, simply submit the given date range you wish to get the market
values from. Note that start date should be in the past.
